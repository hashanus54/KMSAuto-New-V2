## What is KMSAuto?

**KMSAuto** is a powerful, automated solution designed to activate a wide range of Microsoft products — including **Windows (7/8/10/11)** and **Office (2010/2013/2016/2019/2021)** — without the need for retail keys or online verification.

Built on top of Microsoft’s Key Management Service (KMS) protocol, KMSAuto emulates a local KMS server, tricking your system into thinking it's part of a corporate network. The result? Instant, hassle-free activation that just works.
